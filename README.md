## Prototype 1
Currently the first level prototype is finished and contains two puzzles. The goal of this level is to unlock the coffin to find the key to the next room. The first puzzle requires the user to break urns and to find the first key. The second puzzle requires players to pick up a stick, light it on fire using the torches on the walls, and to burn the residue on the entrance of the next room over. Once the player has the keys, the coffin will unlock and the player will be able to open the door to the next room.
